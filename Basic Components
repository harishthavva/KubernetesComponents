Pod :- Basic fundamental unit in Kubernetes ( abstraction over containers is also known as Pod)
Deployments (stateless) :- Abstraction over Pods. In Real time if we want to create Pods we use Deployment component.
Statefulsets (statefull) :-  If we want to create Database Pods we use Statefulset component.
Service :- For each Pod there should be one Permanent IP address known as Service. Mainly services are used for communication b/w the pods.
External Service (Ingress Traffic) :- If users need to use our frontend application then we need expose our service to External then only Public can access it.
configMap :- Here we will store Environment variables, DB urls etc..
Secrets :- Here we will store credentials like username, passwords etc..

Note :- 
Every YAML file contains 2 parts. 
  1. Metadata like Deploymentname,lables..
  2. Specification
